# WebhookPost
A webhook for your application

Add easily a webhook to your application both on Node.js and browser as an
stream of objects. It can be able to use a remote *ServerSent Events* server or
enable an ad-hoc local `POST` web server, both directly or by using a proxy like
[post2sse](https://github.com/piranna/post2sse) or
[browserver](https://github.com/jed/browserver-client).
